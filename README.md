## I am Software Web Developer

  I like building fun, creative websites and side projects that are also performant and accessible.
							After almost five years in the IT business I managed to work with a few technologies. I liked most of them and I would love to learn how to use them better.
							Now I'm teaching myself how to code using React. I'm so excited about this, I want to learn and understand more about this beautiful world of coding.
							I’m constantly searching for new technologies to test and learn by doing, and following different guides I found around the web. I also really like dogs, traveling and camping. These things inspire me a lot. End of course special Thanks and gratitude to my teacher Alla from canshecode.
